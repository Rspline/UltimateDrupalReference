The Ultimate Drupal Reference is an open source project and we'd love to accept **your** contribution too!  
**Thank you for taking the time to contribute!**

## How can I contribute?
### Suggesting enhancements

please open an [issue on GitHub](issues).  
This also applies if you have a better or more up-to-date version of a resource in the reference.

But please check the [reference rules](#reference-rules) before doing so, thank you!

## Reference guidelines

### Content
The project is aimed to be an **up-to-date** reference to resources that can help people become better Drupal developers.  
This includes but is not limited to:
- Drupal modules/themes/distributions
- Tutorials
- Blog posts
- How to videos

**Any** resource, that you think, could improve someone's Drupal skills is welcome!

### Content order
In order not to favor one resource over another, all the lists in the document are sorted **alphabetically**.

### Level of detail 
To ensure simplicity and because there's always multiple solutions to a problem, we only refer to other resources/solutions
and leave the decision of which solution to use up to you.    
For example, we state that the use of Composer is highly recommended but we don't enforce it.  
We point to different modules (which may do the same) but leave the decision to you which to choose/use.

The goal of the project is to be helpful to any Drupal developer, regardless of how exactly they work with Drupal.
