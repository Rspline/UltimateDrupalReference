# Ultimate Drupal Reference
When it comes to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), there are a lot of videos, blog posts and general how-to's out there.  
While some of them are good, others are in need of improvement and a few of them are simply outdated.

This project will try to list you the **best, most promising and most efficient** resources that you might need when developing a Drupal site.  
**Important:** This project currently focuses on Drupal 8 only!  
If you would like to have a Drupal 7 version of it, please open a [GitHub issue](../../issues) so we can discuss it. 

## Contribution guidelines 
This project lives through new and up-to-date resources from the community, from **you**!  
If you would like to add a resource or contribute in any other kind of way, be sure to read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installing Drupal
There are different ways of installing Drupal.
You can either install it directly on your local machine (or any server) or you can also work with a VM if you prefer.  
If you really just want to catch a *quick glimpse* about a specific Drupal distribution, module or theme, then you don't even
need to install anything! Check out the next section for details.

### Evaluate Drupal projects without installing Drupal
No further information needed. Simply visit [simplytest.me](https://simplytest.me/) and launch your custom sandbox!

### Drupal requirements
In order to be able to run Drupal on your machine (or any server), you need a web server with PHP and a SQL database server.
Please check the [official requirements page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements) for more details.

### Official installation page
Up-to-date and detailed instructions can be found on the [official installation page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install).

### Drupal VMs
If you prefer working with a VM, check out following alternatives:
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal/)
- [Drupal VM](https://www.drupalvm.com/)

### Composer
While not required, it's **highly recommended** that you set up your Drupal project with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/),
regardless of your technical setup.  
Check the [Composer template for Drupal projects](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) to install Drupal quickly via Composer.

### Drupal CLI's
When it comes to developing custom modules, themes or simply automate certain tasks with scripts/cronjobs, there are two
major Drupal CLI's which can be a huge help for you:
- [Drupal Console](https://drupalconsole.com/)
- [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) 

## IDE's
There are lots of different IDE's and editors for PHP. But *most* Drupal developers tend to use [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).  
Do you use any other IDE or editor? Please let me know!

## Site building with Drupal
Once you have Drupal set up and running, it's time for site building.  
Have a look at the great documentation on drupal.org about [site building](https://www.drupal.org/site-building)
as well as as understanding the [concepts of Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/understanding-drupal-8/overview).

## Distributions
While Drupal 8 Core comes with lots of functionality already, the strength of Drupal lies in its extensibility.  
Distributions are full copies of Drupal that include Drupal Core, along with additional software such as themes, modules, libraries, and installation profiles.
